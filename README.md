### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Abdo! I am a developer who is passionate about frontend tech and bringings ideas into life. I enjoy working with Angular, Vuejs and React. My focus is to create micro tools that helps other developers to do stuff. When I am coding I always do it keeping in mind that the next devolopers finds it easy to understand and to maintain. Don't reinvent the wheel, just realign it is my motto. I enjoy creating components that meets the requirements of the design systems, best practices and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA standards.

I like coding chanllenges, optimising algorithms implementations and finding performent solutions for complex problems. 

```javascript
{
    code: ["Javascript", "Typescript" "php"],
    technologies: {
        mobileApp: ["Ionic"],
        frontEnd: {
            js: ["Angular", "Vue", "Nuxt", "React"],
            css: ["SCSS", "Material design", "bootstrap"],
            Misc:  ["Accessibility"]
        },
        backEnd: {
            js: ["node", "express"],
        },
        devOps: {
                 AWS : ["AWS CDK", "cloudfront", "CloudFront", "CloudFormation", "Roue53", "EC2"],
                 Docker
        },
        databases: ["mongo", "MySql", "sqlite"],
    },
    architecture: ["Serverless Architecture", "Progressive web applications", "Single page applications"],
