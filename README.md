I am Abdo! I am a developer who is passionate about frontend tech and bringings ideas into life. I enjoy working with Angular, Vuejs and React. My focus is to create micro tools that helps other developers to do stuff. When I am coding I always do it keeping in mind that the next devolopers finds it easy to understand and to maintain. Don't reinvent the wheel, just realign it is my motto. I enjoy creating components that meets the requirements of the design systems, best practices and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA standards.

I like coding chanllenges, optimising algorithms implementations and finding performent solutions for complex problems.
